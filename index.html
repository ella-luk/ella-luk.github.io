    <p>currently pursuing a degree in psychological & brain sciences with a minor in media arts and design at ucsb, ella luk is an interdisciplinary artist driven by her desire for eternalizing the things that make her *feel* in any sort of medium. jack of all trades, master of some (or so she thinks), ella's art spans across multiple formsâ€”ranging from ceramics and graphite to ui/ux design, video editing, and film photography. in her free time, she dances. </p>
